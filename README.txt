Collection of OpenSCAD files/modules/etc. of my design for a variety
of purposes, but generally modelmaking and useful things for around
the house.

I'm a programmer, so I treat this all as code. As such, all code in
this repository is licensed under the Gnu General Public license (see
below).

For the git nerds who may use this - I normally don't check in output
files, but github has a nifty STL viewer and folks should be able to
download and print the STL files directly, so it's all around nicer
and easier to commit them, so I am.
